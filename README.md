# Master-thesis-2021
You will find all relevant code for my thesis in this folder. Most of the files are used, and there is a small describtion in the beginning of all files. The files should run with no problems, and the reader can change constants and variable as he/she wants. 

The relevant library has to be implementet and I use an Anaconda environment. 

Note that the files with "BS" in the name, is about Black Scholes models, which only occur in the Appendix.
